# Flexibility Structure Analyzer

## Site: <https://flexibility-analyzer.netlify.com/>

The Flexibility Structure Analyzer is a web-based tool that allows people who wish to design a flexible system to check and verify whether their designed system's structure is as efficient or robust as a fully flexible system and to compare it with systems.
