      The Flexibility Structure Analyzer is a web-based tool that allows people who wish to design a flexible system to check and verify whether their designed system's structure is as efficient or robust as a fully flexible system and to compare it with systems. Thus, the analyzer not only provides a quick way for users to check their designed flexible systems, but also facilitates the design process. <br><br>
